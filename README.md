# agmsg

Cross-agent messaging for CLI AI agents. No daemon, no network, no complexity.

Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, and any CLI agent can message each other via a shared SQLite database.

Two `monitor`-mode Claude Code instances, left alone in the same team, play tic-tac-toe against each other with no human in the loop — each picks up the other's move in real time:

In real use it looks like this — Claude Code asking Codex for a code review and getting it back, all over agmsg:

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (one-liner)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujibee/agmsg/main/setup.sh)

# Or clone first if you want to inspect the code
git clone https://github.com/fujibee/agmsg.git && cd agmsg && ./install.sh

# 2. Restart Claude Code / Codex / Cursor to pick up the new skill

# 3. Run the command — it will prompt for team and agent name on first use
#    Claude Code:  /agmsg
#    Codex:        $agmsg
#    Cursor:       /agmsg or /skills
```

That's it. Once two agents have joined the same team, they can message each other. On first join, you'll be asked to pick a **delivery mode** — see [Delivery modes](#delivery-modes) below for the four options. The default on Claude Code is `monitor` (real-time push); Codex defaults to `turn` (between-turns check) because it has no Monitor tool. **Cursor CLI** is manual inbox + optional `turn` via project `.cursor/hooks.json` plus `.cursor/rules/agmsg.mdc` guidance.

After setup, your agent handles everything — just talk to it naturally. "Send alice a message saying the deploy is done", "check my messages", "who's on the team" all work. The shell scripts below are for reference and advanced use.

## Install

```bash
./install.sh              # Interactive (asks command name, default: agmsg)
./install.sh --cmd m      # Non-interactive with custom command name
```

The **command name** determines:
- Skill folder: `~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/`
- Claude Code: `/<cmd>`
- Codex: `$<cmd>`

After install, **restart your agent** (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor) so it picks up the new skill.

## Join a Team

Agents join teams by **identity**: `(agent name, team)`. Projects are stored as registration metadata, so the same agent can re-join from multiple projects without creating duplicate identities. The easiest way:

1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Run `/<cmd>` (e.g. `/agmsg`)
3. It detects you're not in a team and asks for team name and agent name

Or join manually:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project
```

To leave a team:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/leave.sh myteam alice
```

To rename a team (moves the team dir, updates `config.json`, migrates messages):

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/rename-team.sh oldteam newteam
```

**Effect on existing members:** all agents in the team keep their registrations
and message history — only the team name changes. However, any session that has
already cached the team name (e.g. a running `/agmsg` Claude Code session) will
continue to use the old name until it re-resolves identity. After a rename,
each member should re-run `whoami` from their project to pick up the new name:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" claude-code
```

### Multiple identities

You can join the same project with multiple agent names (e.g. `cc` and `reviewer`). When the command detects multiple identities, it asks which one to use for the session.

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam cc claude-code /path/to/project
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam reviewer claude-code /path/to/project
```

### Multiple roles per project (`actas` / `drop`)

Same project, same agent type, different role — for example a `tech-lead` identity for architecture reviews and a `biz-analyst` identity for requirements work, both living on top of the same workspace. Toolset and assets are shared; only the role differs.

```
/agmsg actas tech-lead     # switch to tech-lead (creates it if not yet registered)
/agmsg actas biz-analyst   # switch to biz-analyst
/agmsg drop biz-analyst    # remove the role from this project
```

Mechanics:

- `actas <name>` is **exclusive**: switches both sending and receiving to `<name>`. The skill joins the role under your current team if needed, then TaskStops the running `agmsg inbox stream` Monitor and relaunches one filtered to `<name>` only (via `watch.sh`'s optional 4th argument). Messages addressed to other roles stop reaching the session until you `actas` again or end the session.
- `drop <name>` removes only that role's registration for this project (via `reset.sh`). If the role is no longer registered anywhere, it's also dropped from the team config. If `<name>` was the currently-active role, the watcher is restarted in default mode (all roles registered for this project at relaunch time).
- Switching is session-scoped state held by the agent. `/clear` or a new session resets back to the multiple-identities picker.

#### Subscription model

agmsg follows a **one CC session = one active role** model. Each watcher subscribes to a *static* set of identities decided at launch:

- **Without `actas`**: the watcher subscribes to whichever `(team, agent)` pairs were registered for this `(project, agent_type)` at the moment `watch.sh` started. The set is *not* re-resolved later. A role joined mid-session via `actas` from another CC does *not* start arriving in CCs that were launched before it.
- **After `actas <name>`**: the watcher is relaunched filtered to `<name>` only. Other registered roles stop arriving in this CC even if they pre-existed.

This is intentional: it keeps each CC bound to one role's inbox, so a `tech-lead` window stays clear of `biz-analyst` traffic and vice versa — even when both roles are registered under the same project. To pick up a role added after a CC launched (without switching to it exclusively), restart the CC or `/clear` so SessionStart re-launches `watch.sh` with the fresh identity list.

The send side mirrors this: every `send.sh` call from this CC uses the active role as the `from` agent, whether that's the implicit one (default) or the one set by the most recent `actas`.

### Reusing the same identity across projects

If you join the same team with the same agent name from another project, agmsg keeps the same identity and adds a registration record for the new project.

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project-a
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/join.sh myteam alice claude-code /path/to/project-b
```

If you want to clear the current project's registrations without leaving the team identity entirely:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/reset.sh /path/to/project-b claude-code
```

## Delivery modes

How incoming messages reach your agent. Pick one at first join via the prompt, or change it later with `/agmsg mode <name>`.

| mode | mechanism | latency | who it's for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`monitor`** (default on Claude Code) | SessionStart hook → Monitor tool → blocking SQLite stream | ~5s | Claude Code users wanting real-time push |
| **`turn`** (default on Codex) | Stop hook fires `check-inbox.sh` between assistant turns | until your next interaction | Codex (no Monitor tool); Claude Code users on a quieter loop |
| **`both`** | monitor primary, turn as per-session safety net | ~5s; falls back to turn-end on watcher failure | belt-and-suspenders |
| **`off`** | no automatic delivery | manual `/agmsg` only | minimalists |

**Cursor CLI** supports **`turn`** and **`off`** only (no Monitor tool). Turn mode uses project `.cursor/hooks.json` (`hooks.stop[]`) and returns `followup_message` on unread mail. `delivery.sh set turn cursor <project>` also creates or updates `.cursor/rules/agmsg.mdc`, which is the always-on Cursor guidance for using agmsg scripts. `set off` removes the hook but leaves the rule in place for manual use. agmsg does not auto-generate `.cursor/skills` or `AGENTS.md`.

### Picking a mode

```
/agmsg mode monitor    — switch this project to real-time push (Claude Code)
/agmsg mode turn       — switch to between-turns checking
/agmsg mode both       — monitor with turn as a safety net
/agmsg mode off        — manual /agmsg only
/agmsg mode            — show current mode
```

Settings are per-project. Each `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` gets exactly the hooks the chosen mode needs — repeated `set` calls are idempotent.

### Migrating from legacy `hook on/off`

`hook on` is now a thin alias for `mode turn` (with a one-line deprecation hint). To switch to real-time push:

```
/agmsg mode monitor
```

The command updates `db/config.yaml`, rewrites the project's hook entries, and prints an `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` that activates `monitor` in the current session — no agent restart needed.

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/agmsg                                  — check inbox (all teams)
/agmsg history                          — message history
/agmsg team                             — list team members
/agmsg send <agent> <message>           — send message
/agmsg mode <monitor|turn|both|off>     — switch delivery mode
/agmsg mode                             — show current mode
/agmsg actas <name>                     — switch to another role in this project (create if needed)
/agmsg drop <name>                      — remove a role from this project
/agmsg hook on | off                    — legacy aliases (mode turn | off)
/agmsg reset                            — clear current project registration
```

### Codex

```
$agmsg                          — or /skills → agmsg
```

Codex supports `mode turn` and `mode off` only — there's no Monitor tool to stream into.

### Cursor CLI

Manual: use `/agmsg` or `/skills` as the entry point, then run agmsg scripts from the agent. The installed `SKILL.md` is useful for manual startup, while `.cursor/rules/agmsg.mdc` is the always-on project guidance configured by turn delivery. Typical flow:

```bash
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" cursor
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <agent>
~/.agents/skills/agmsg/scripts/delivery.sh set turn cursor "$(pwd)"
```

- **turn** — creates/updates `.cursor/hooks.json` and managed `.cursor/rules/agmsg.mdc`; stop hook → `check-inbox-cursor.sh` → `followup_message` when unread (not `decision:block` / `systemMessage`)
- **off** — manual script calls only
- **monitor / both** — not supported on Cursor

Markerless existing `.cursor/rules/agmsg.mdc` files are left untouched with a warning. Other files under `.cursor/rules/` are not modified.

### Shell (any agent)

```bash
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/send.sh <team> <from> <to> "<message>"
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <agent_id>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/history.sh <team> [agent_id] [limit]
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/team.sh <team>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/whoami.sh <project_path> <type>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> <type> <project_path>
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/delivery.sh status [<type> <project_path>]
~/.agents/skills/<cmd>/scripts/reset.sh <project_path> <type> [agent_id]
```

`hook.sh on|off` still works as a legacy alias for `delivery.sh set turn|off` but prints a deprecation notice.

## Update

```bash
cd agmsg
git pull
./install.sh --update
```

DB and team configs are preserved. Only scripts and assets are updated.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh              # Interactive (confirms each step)
./uninstall.sh --yes        # Remove everything
./uninstall.sh --keep-data  # Remove skill but keep DB and teams
```

Auto-detects installed skill directories and cleans up: skill files, slash commands, hooks, AGENTS.md sections, and team configs.

## Tests

```bash
bats tests/    # requires bats-core: brew install bats-core
```
